# Portfolio Website with Svelte and FastAPI
## Overview üîç
This repository contains my personal portfolio website, built using the Svelte framework for the frontend and FastAPI for the backend. The architecture follows a microservices approach, allowing for modularity, scalability, and easy integration.

## Key Stack üöÄ
Svelte: A modern JavaScript framework for building reactive web applications. Svelte simplifies frontend development by compiling components into highly efficient JavaScript code during build time.
FastAPI: A Python web framework that leverages asynchronous programming (ASGI) for high performance. FastAPI is well-suited for building APIs and microservices due to its speed and ease of use.
